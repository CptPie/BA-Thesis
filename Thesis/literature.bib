  abstract = {Software systems have been using "just-in-time" compilation (JIT)
              techniques since the 1960s. Broadly, JIT compilation includes any
              translation performed dynamically, after a program has started
              execution. We examine the motivation behind JIT compilation and
              constraints imposed on JIT compilation systems, and present a
              classification scheme for such systems. This classification emerges
              as we survey forty years of JIT work, from 1960--2000.},

  publisher = {Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc.},
  address = {USA},
  abstract = {From the Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface)Advances in
              the design and production of computer hardware have brought many
              more people into direct contact with computers. Similar advances in
              the design and production of computer software are required in
              order that this increased contact be as rewarding as possible. The
              Smalltalk-80 system is a result of a decade of research into
              creating computer software that is appropriate for producing highly
              functional and interactive contact with personal computer systems.
              This book is the first detailed account of the Smalltalk-80 system.
              It is divided into four major parts:Part One -- an overview of the
              concepts and syntax of the programming language.Part Two -- an
              annotated and illustrated specification of the system's
              functionality.Part Three -- an example of the design and
              implementation of a moderate-size application.Part Four -- a
              specification of the Smalltalk-80 virtual machine.},
